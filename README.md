# PhysNumericDemo
Solving kinematics problems with numerical methods.

Intended for professors, TAs and students working on `PHYS1111` or `PHYS1113`.

Some casual work... still in progress~

Get rid of that Excel, bro. This is the future!

## Background

There are *three important vectors* when it comes to describing the movement of a particle. Namely, **displacement**, **velocity** and **acceleration**.

All three can be written as functions of time $t$: $\vec{x}(t)$, $\vec{v}(t)$ and $\vec{a}(t)$.

Certain mathematical relations can also be found between these three:
